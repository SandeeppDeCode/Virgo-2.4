/*
Given an integer array nums, sorted in ascending order (with distinct values) and a target value k. The array is rotated at some pivot point that is unknown. Find the index at which k is present and if k is not present return -1.

Certainly! Hereâ€™s a very concise note on how to narrow down the search in a rotated sorted array using binary search:

---

Narrowing Down the Search

1. Identify Sorted Half: Determine if the left or right half of the array is sorted.
2. Check Target Range:
   - If the left half is sorted and the target lies within that range, search the left half.
   - If the right half is sorted and the target lies within that range, search the right half.
3. Adjust Pointers: Update `low` and `high` pointers based on where to search next.
