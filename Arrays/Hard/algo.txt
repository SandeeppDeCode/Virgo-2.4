Moore's Voting Algorithm - Quick Notes
Purpose
    Finds the majority element (appears > n/2 times) in an array.
    Steps
    Candidate Selection:
    Initialize count = 0, el.
    Iterate through the array:
    If count == 0, set el to current element and count = 1.
    If nums[i] == el, increment count.
    Else, decrement count.

Validation:
    Count occurrences of el.
    Return el if count > n/2; otherwise, return -1.
Complexity
Time: O(n)
Space: O(1)
